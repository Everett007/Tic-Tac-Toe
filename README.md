# Tic-Tac-Toe
A tic tac toe project I've been working on.
This project is a test for my Python skills.
I am in 8th grade and I am trying to learn as much as I can.
# Why?
Computers are everywhere nowadays.
It's important to learn how to communicate with the computers.
Or program them, at least :)
# How did I learn?
With a lot of help from people.
My parents helped me a lot as well as my schoole teachers.
